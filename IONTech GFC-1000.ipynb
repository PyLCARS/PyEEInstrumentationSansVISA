    "The goal of this program/notebook is to develop a program that can control and log a circa ~1988 3 Channel mass flow controller. Since this mass flow controller was developed before the SCPI standardized it uses custom RS-232 commands and thus is it vary unlikely that this equipment is supported by a VISA library. Thus custom programming is necessary.\n",
